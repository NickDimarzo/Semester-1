# While Loop Without Errors ex 11
# Author: Group 14

# Broken Code
# Some_number = 0  (Snake case corrections)
# i = 1 (Fine)
# While i < 11 (Added semicolon)
# 	Some_number += 1 (Snake case corrections)
#   i += 1           (Need to update the index)
# Print some_number  (Snake case corrections, capitalization, included bubble brackets)

# Fixed Code
